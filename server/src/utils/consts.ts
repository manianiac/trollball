  'Trollball is a game where 2 teams fight over possession of a leather mimickry of a Troll head. The teams are equipped with blunted weapons and armor, and fighting is encouraged. The game is similar to Basketball where there is a large field divided into halves, with a basket on the ground at each end that the Trollball needs to be deposited into. There is a 2 point line around it, where getting the ball into the basket scores an additional point. The game is similar to rugby in that you carry the ball and run with it, trying to get to the opposing basket while fighting off your enemies. There is a lot of waiting for an opening to try and break through a defensive line.'
